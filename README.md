# Part 1: Conditional Statements

## Description
This program prompts the user to input a number and uses a 'switch' statement to print a message based on the input value. The messages correspond to specific values: 
- -1 prints "negative one"
- 0 prints "zero"
- 1 prints "positive one"
- and a default message for any other number

## How to Run the Code
   - Clone the repository or download the C++ code file to your local machine.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the C++ file.
   - Compile the program using a C++ compiler. 
   - Run the program on your local machine
   - The program will prompt you to enter a number. Based on the number you enter, it will print the corresponding message.

# Part 2: Printing a Vector

## Description
In this part of the project, a function `print_vector` is implemented to print the elements of a vector in C++. This function loops through the vector and prints each element to the console. 

## Output
The program will output the numbers in the vector, separated by spaces

# Part 3: While Loops (Fibonacci Sequence)

## Description
This program generates the Fibonacci sequence using a `while` loop. Starting with the first two numbers in the sequence (1 and 2), it calculates and prints each subsequent number until the value exceeds 4,000,000.

## Output
The output will display the Fibonacci numbers up to 4,000,000
